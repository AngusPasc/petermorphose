# Peter Morphose - experimental RubyMotion port

This is a proof-of-concept port of an existing Ruby/Gosu codebase to RubyMotion. If you have RubyMotion installed, this is all it should take to run the game:

```bash
bundle
bundle exec rake pod:install
bundle exec rake
```

For more information about this game, see the master branch. --Julian
