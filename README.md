It's just me, remaking Peter Morphose with Ruby/Gosu for the LD#21 Jam.

This game was written in Delphi 5 with DelphiX, which has led me to write my own Gosu gamedev library for C++, which I interfaced with Ruby, and now I am rewriting the game in it.

Also, I am trying to make everything nice and pretty and like a modern Ruby gem so that I might have a useful reference Gosu game later on.
