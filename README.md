## What is Peter Morphose?

Peter Morphose is a jump-and-run-and-survive platformer I wrote between 2000 and 2001, using Borland Delphi and the DelphiX. It was available only for Windows and only in German. The integrated level editor was popular with fans, but I never managed to build a community site to share those levels. I made some available in a level pack, though.

## What is this repository?

This repository is a work-in-progress rewrite of Peter Morphose using Ruby and Gosu, with the following differences:

* Runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux
* Supports English and German
* Simplified controls
* Simplified gameplay
* Full gamepad support
* Level compatibility with the original game is retained

## Why oh why remake such a frustrating game?

* I was jamming along the Ludum Dare #21 competition with the given theme 'Escape'. Peter Morphose was a natural match.
* The existing source code was neither public nor versioned. It was fantastically terrible too.
* Translating from Delphi to Ruby sounded easy enough, given how similar the languages look like.
* I wanted to have a new toy Ruby game to try to get running in NaCl. I ran out of time just porting the game though.

## But there is still so much wrong about the game!

Feel free to fork it :)
